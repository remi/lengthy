# Lengthy

**Lengthy** is a [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome)/[Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/) extension that adds a table of contents to `README` files on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## Installation

Currently, the only way to install the extension is to enable Chromeâ€™s developer mode, click on **Load unpacked extension** and select this directory.

This is not a *real* extension yet. It will be soon.

## Screenshot

Here is a screenshot of what the table of contents looks like. The table is hidden by default and can be shown by clicking on the arrow in the top-right corner.
